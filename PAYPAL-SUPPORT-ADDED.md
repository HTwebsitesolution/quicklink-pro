# 💝 PayPal Support Link Added

## Changes Made:

Updated the navigation header in all frontend files to include a PayPal donation link:

### Files Modified:
- `index.html` - Main development frontend
- `production-frontend.html` - Production optimized frontend  
- `frontend-connected.html` - Connected frontend version

### Changes:
- Changed "Support" and "Contact" links to PayPal donation link
- Added 💝 emoji for visual appeal
- Configured to open in new tab (`target="_blank"`)
- Added security attributes (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`)

## ✅ Action Completed:

**Updated with actual PayPal link: `https://paypal.me/quicklinkpro`**

The donation link is now properly configured in all frontend files:
```html
<a href="https://paypal.me/quicklinkpro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">💝 Support</a>
```

## 🚀 Next Steps:
1. Update the PayPal username in all three files
2. Commit and push the changes
